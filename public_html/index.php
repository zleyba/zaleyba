								My name is Zach and I'm a digital communications expert and creative professional.
								I specialize in social media management, web design, and event promotion/planning.
								I'm a recent graduate of UNM with a BA in Mass Communications and I also recently
									completed the CNM Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, a 10-week web development intensive.
								I consider myself to be a budding public speaker, and my 13+ years of musical performance
									experience illustrates how comfortable I can be up front and center.
								</p>
								<p>
									Growing up in the sleepy New Mexican capitol of Santa Fe, I had often had to find ways
									to entertain myself. The two biggest things that took up my time were music and the Internet.
									I loved all the possibilities the Internet provided and eagerly taught myself HTML at the age
									of 11 in order to build fansites for my favorite animes. Eventually I started a band and
									learned how to promote my own shows. I photocopied crudely designed fliers and
									bought a domain. I designed my band's website, and helped sell our hand-screen tees. I set out
									on a path and I'm happy to see that you've stumbled upon it.

								</p>
								<p>
									Now that you're here, I'd love for you to check out my work. Let me know if need anything!
